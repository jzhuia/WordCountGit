The environmental pollution is worse and worsetoday. Many trees are cut down, and water and air are polluted. As a student Itry to have a low-carbon life to save energy and reduce pollution.Firstly, I often walk to school. It can reduceair pollution. Secondly, I always turn off the lights and fans when leaving theclassroom. Thirdly, I always make full use of paper and other school things andnever waste water.I wish more students to join me and make theearth more and more beautiful.
